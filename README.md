# Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio! 

## About Me üôÇ

Hi, I‚Äôm Manal JEWA, and I‚Äôm a **Data Analyst** with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. After working in **customer success** at an agricultural e-commerce company, I leveraged data to improve customer satisfaction, enhance the user experience, and drive growth. Now, I am transitioning into a full-time data analyst role where I can apply my analytical skills to business challenges.

I have recently completed the **Data Analysis program at DataScientest**, certified by **l'√âcole des Mines de Paris**, where I mastered the core tools and techniques of data analysis, including **SQL**, **Python**, **Power BI**, and **data visualization**. This program has equipped me with the skills to solve real-world data problems, perform in-depth analysis, and communicate insights effectively.

I‚Äôm excited to apply these skills in a dynamic business environment, where I can help organizations leverage data to improve decision-making and drive business success.
